# Camera

This is an old set of simple shell scripts as a quick and dirty solution to have a bunch of RaspberryPIs snap a picture every second and push them in batches to a central NAS server.<br>
This was a very quick and stable project that actually ran for several months.  Haven't used it since 2018.<br>
This project is superseded by my MotionDetector project (Python and OpenCV to detect motion and running on more platforms than RPi only).
